From remote to local repository:
---------------------------------
git clone (to clone from remote repository to local)
git status (to check the status)
git add <file_name> (for adding the file to stage)
git add . (for adding all new/modified files to stage)
git commit -m "write some comment mentioning the change in this version"
git push origin main

How to add local repository to remote?
---------------------------------------
git init (to initiate git in a local folder/directory)
git remote add origin <link>
git remote -v (to verify remote)
git push -u origin main (-u will create short cut so that from next time onward we can use only git push)

Branch commands
----------------
git branch (to check branch)
git branch -M main (to rename branch)
git checkout <to branch name> (to navigate to other branch<to branch name> from current branch)
git checkout -b <new_branch_name> (to create new branch)
git checkout -d <branch_name> (to delete a branch. One thing to note, we can't delete current branch, means if you are in feature2 branch
and wants to delte feature2 branch, you can not. You need to checkout to other branch and then delete feature2 branch)

Marging commands
-----------------
git diff <branch_name> (to compare differences between current branch and branch_name)
git merge <branch_name> (to merge 2 branches)
git pull origin main 

Undoing changes:
-----------------
case 1: after add step
git reset <file_name> (to restore to previous version of <file_name>)
git reset (to restore all the files to previous version)

case 2: after commit
git reset HEAD~1 (restore to previous version)
git log (to display commit log)

case 3: after commit to certain version
git reset <hash_commit> (here <hash> is the version hash number)
git reset --hard <hash_commit> (it will reset the local vs code verion too)

Fork:
-------
using fork, we can copy the project, then we can make our chages and try to pull it again to the original project.
basically fork is a rough copy.


How to change/set gloabl parameters?
